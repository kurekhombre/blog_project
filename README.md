# Django Blog

## Demo


## About

The blog was created while learning from Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's Course on Udemy.      
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-the-practical-guide/    

The course deals with topics such as:
- Basics of Django (MTV, Admin panel, Forms and so on...)
- Class Views & Generic Views
- Sessions
- Deployment on AWS

The project is actually rewritten, but sometimes I used my own inventions :)
